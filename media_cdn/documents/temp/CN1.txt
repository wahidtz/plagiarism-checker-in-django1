Introduction 
 
As an employee of Nguyen Networking Limited the project to implement a networking environment 
for an educational institute to connect  200 students 15 teachers 12 marketing and administration 
staff 5 higher managers including the head of academics and the programme manager 3 computer 
network administrators  needs an important emphasis on various network types and topologies in 
order to establish a seamless and hassle free network environment As for this institute using LAN 
and WLAN can be very helpful as LAN can connect more end devices in a building and WLAN is 
helpful to integrate wireless on the go connection to the network As this network contains a 
considerably huge amount of end users the bandwith required has to be high and may require star 
topology  as star is much faster to intersect and nodes have an agreed decision on which the core is 
The inclusion of a network system will increase the rate at which information is shared thus 
increasing productivity In order to establish networks servers are crucial parts of the system as they 
are required to store and process data at speedy rates enabling the procedure of the system to be 
efficient From the various network models Usually P2P models are faster as the end devices are the 
only devices required to run the networking tasks relinquishing the hassle of server queries and 
protocols  which can slow down the process If the institution requires a less costly alternative  then 
thin client can be a better alternative with its processing power taking place on remote servers  
which reduces the cost of ownership and maintenance costs   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Task A Explain the need for different computer network types and models 
What is a Network 
 A collection of Computers which are interconnected as a result as a result multiple computers are 
able to communicate with each other and are able to share their Resources Data Applications 
 
To form a Network we need to consider several types 
 
 LAN 
 WLAN 
 MAN 
 WAN 
 SAN 
 
There are several characteristics of those Network Types 
 
1 LANLocal Area Network  It is a relatively inexpensive Network type built with Hubs  
Network Adapters and Ethernet Cables which can link up several PCs through a relaying 
medium consisted of twisted pairs  coaxial cablesetc This Network Type introduces faster 
data transfer speeds as it is included locally and has higher security LAN can be implemented 
in a building or an office 
 
 
2 MANMetropolitan Area Network  MAN has a higher coverage than LAN 
As a result it can cover a larger Geographical Area by the help of different  
LAN networks interconnecting through a Telephone exchange line Uses of MAN include 
 
Government Agencies to connect to Citizens and Private Industries The most widely used 
 
protocols in MAN are RS232Frame  RelayATMISDNOC3ADSLetc 
3 WANWide Area Network  A WAN is more superior to a LAN network in range and is not 
limited to a particular area  but rather spreads over a large Geographical area such as States or 
Countries by the help of Telephone line Fibre optics or Satellite links Internet is an example of 
the greatest WAN in the world and is often needed in the field of Government Business and 
Education 
 
 
 
 
4 SAN  The presentation of interconnected multiple pools of devices are known as SAN They 
are used to access storage devices such as Disk Arrays and Tape Libraries etc such that it 
would appear to be directly attached to the operating system 
 
5 WLAN  A wire free network that connects numerous with the help of Wireless Communication 
to form a LAN within a home  school computer laboratory  office building etc This allows 
mobility while being connected to the network WLANs are based on IEEE 80211 also known 
as WiFi can include a connection to the wider Internet through a gateway 
There are several characteristics of those network types  
 Intranet  An Intranet belongs to an Organization containing a private network deemed only 
accessible by an Organizations Employees or members It is based on the Internet protocol such 
as Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol aimed to relay and resources among 
the Organizations employees  providing the facility to work together or teleconferences Some 
examples of Intranet are chats email andor blogs 
 
 Extranet  Categorized as MAN WAN or other computer networks it is crucial for Extranet to 
have an external connection rather than just a LAN It is only restricted to users who have login 
credentials and can be used for information sharing An EXTRANET is the least level of 
internetworking 
 Internet  A global network of trillion of computers and other computer devices  which allows 
us get almost any information and communicate to anyone else in the world 
 Cloud  Servers that can be approached over the net software and databases that process on 
those servers Files and applications can be run on any particular devices as   computing and 
storage takes place in servers that are run from data centers instead of being run locally on the 
user device 
 
 
 
 
 
Network Models 
 Peer to peer  A p2p network is said to take place between several computer systems that 
communicate to each other over the net Direct file sharing occurs between two systems with the 
 
 
 
 
exclusion of a Central server denoting that the computer systems involved in p2p networks 
becomes a server and a client as well Common examples of p2p software programs are  
LimeWire  Bearshareetc  
 
 Client  Server  ClientServer network contains one central powerful computer recognized as a 
server which works as a hub and is connected to multiple less capable personal computers or 
workstations also known as clients Thus these clients can run programs and get data that are 
stored on the server 
 Thin Client  It contains no data processing power rather the power is given by the CPU 
hardrive and memory of a different server For companies to implement Thin Client servers and 
terminal server farms  can allow for lowered cost of ownership and reduced support 
requirements  
Task B Explain the characteristics and functions of network components 
 
Computer Networks is formed my mustering several Electronical Devices which connect and interact 
between each other for the existence of smooth transfer of data between individual devices  with the 
exclusion of any hitch 
 
 A Network Component is of two types  
i Hardware Components 
Ii Software Components 
 
 
Hardware Components 
 
Hardware Components can be put up into numerous elements 
 
 End User Devices  Distinguishable by unique addresses  End User Devices canreinact being 
both the transmitter and receiver  viceversa  in a network Some examples of End User 
Devices are  PC  Mobile Phones  Tablets  Server etc 
 
 
 
 
 
 Connectivity Devices  
 
i Switch  A Networking Device that links various devices within a Network through Packet 
Switching to receive and transmitforward data to the destination device rather than broadcasting 
            Router  With the help of RJ45 ports Routers are connected to the LAN  and as a result can 
connect the various End Devices present on the Network to the broadband internet connection 
 
 
ii Hub  A device that connects multiple Ethernet Devices  thus forming a single Network segment 
It is established by holding up several input or output devices  in order input at a single port is 
available to each different posts 
 
 Connection Media  
 
The Computer Network is put in contact together with the help of  Coaxial Cable  Twisted Pair  
Fibre Optic Cable  
 
To connect Hardware components through IP address we need Network Interface Card NIC An 
NIC card operates by changing the local IP address of the data sent by the End Device into a 
globally known IP address and transmitting data to another recipient End Device The NIC card of 
the End Device  again transforms the IP address of the received data from a globally known IP 
into a locally known IP 
 
 
 Software Components   
 
i Network System Software  In order for a Network System Software to be formed an 
OSOperating System needs to be installed both on the sender and recipient End Devices For 
Example  Windows 10  Mac  Linux 
ii Network Applications  A Network Application is run by one host  to provide communication to 
to another application ran by different hosts These can be formed through different Databases 
 Oracle Microsoft SQL Server Web based application  Facebook Twitter Gmail etc 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Task C Analyze the functions of different network components required to 
construct different network types  
 
Networks can be formed in several types  LAN MAN WAN 
 LAN 
 
 
A network that links up computers within a limited area such as library  schools  
officeHardware components of LAN are consisted of End devices such as Pcworskations and 
servers LAN is provided through cabling and connectors  eg Coaxial cable and BNC connector  
Unshielded twisted pair UTP 
 
And RJ45 connectors The devices are connected across the network using devices such as Hubs 
Bridge LAN switch and router repeater A crucial part of the hardware components is a NIC card 
Network Interface Card which allows the IP address of the sent data to be converted from local to 
a more recognized global IP for easier transfer of data 
Software components of LAN include NIC software drivers Both the server and clients need to have 
Network Operating System such as Novell Netware 41 client or Microsoft WIndows 95  Mac 
OS Also Network Protocol Software TCPIPTransmission Control ProtocolInternet Protocol TO 
utilize the network many application software can be used Gmail  Internet Web Browser Database 
Software  Networking Software 
 MAN 
                   MAN is a network formed by joining multiple LAN networks to cover a larger 
geographic area It makes use of the devices already present in a LAN netwrok As a result the MAN 
has a higher range compared to LAN  It is mostly use in Government OrganizationsMAN  is 
transmitted through Modem and WireCable 
 WAN 
 
 
WAN requires also multiple LAN connections to work together in order to work End devices are 
connected through the routers to the network Lan provides the connection by the use of cables eg 
Coaxial cable and BNC connector  Unshielded twisted pair UTP and RJ45 connectorsNetwork 
Interface Card is also contained in the network which disguises the local 
IP address into a globally recognised IP address and creates a default gateway for the router to 
broadcast the data The data is sent through the medium of Radio Transmission  
 
 
 
 
 
TaskD Evaluate different network models and their suitability to meet 
different client requirements 
 
 Peertopeer  A server excluded server solution that enables communication of several network 
devices and easier sharing of resources displaying a distributed architecture All devices 
included in a P2P network are identified as peers  where each pair has the similar equality 
which induces similar rights and duties as each and every other peer No peer is superior and 
resources are shared with  no primary central device of a network server is present Such 
shared resources contain  processor usage disk storage capacity or network bandwidth  
 
The goal of a P2P  network model is to establish a seamless environment and enables different 
computers and devices to work together in order to provide specific requests or tasks As P2P 
networks are capable of deploying tasks  such as processing power network bandwidth or disk 
storage space they are best suited for file sharing as they allow simultaneous sharing and 
receiving of files 
 
An example of a P2P  network is BitTorrent or any other torrent platform The platform is 
 
comprised of multiple end devices such as PC workstations etc The file is fetched in several 
 
pieces to ensure ease of access and speed  at the same time the parts of the files that are already 
 
downloaded on your computer is automatically seeded in other words the PC starts sharing the 
 
bits of data to other PCs in the network establishing a seamless process resembling a two way 
 
street 
 
 Clientserver Model  Clientserver model is a recount of the way in which servers share 
resources and serve one or more clients Majority servers deploy a onetomany relationship for 
clients providing multiple resources to a clients at one time Examples of servers can be web 
servers mail servers and file servers whereas client devices can be desktop computers laptops 
tablets and smart phones  
  
Client servers can be used differently but it is distinguished from peertopeer model by the 
 
inclusion of a central server whereas in P2P each individual machine can act as both a client as 
 
well as the server  
An example for the use of Clientserver Model  is when a Bank customer uses Online Banking 
 
to access hisher data A request is initiated through a web browser towards the banks server To 
 
get back data the server accesses the database server which contains the credentials of the 
 
 
 
 
 
customers login information  as a client A process brought forward by the business logic 
 
established by the bank run by an application sever interprets the returned data and displays it in 
 
the web browser All these steps are carried out exchanging requests to a computer for placing  
 
processing requests and returning data 
 Thin Client  A server or a server farm is the main source of providing processing power to the 
unlike from a desktop consisted of CPU memory and hard drive Hence a Thin Client has no 
processing power of its ownThin Client and Terminal Servers have advantages such as 
producing significantly lower cost of ownershipTCO with reduced support requirements 
 
An example of Thin Client is Wyse thin client which enables for Windows application to run on 
 
the cloud reducing management costs and increase security as it is a locked down environment 
A web browser can also act as a thin client  When an applet is downloaded with the inclusion of 
 
plugins or virtual machines as a part of the Web application  here the browser acts as a thin 
 
client as it is displaying a processing of data without any work done by the machine  rather the 
 
processing takes place in a remote server or server firm
